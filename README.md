# Change-Random-Background-Color-App

In this app, my html document has;
-one h1 tag with a stationary text
-under this tag i have an empty span tag I sent text with js into it
-There are two buttons in the middle of the page, one triggered by a click and the other by a mouse over of it 

* in my js code;
* there is an array which consist of 141 html color names in it
* Inside my event functions I wrote a code which produce a random number and use this number as an index number of htmlcolor array's values

when the buttons triggered the random color name append in the css file's body selector with a background-color property.
